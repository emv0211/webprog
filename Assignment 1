	This is an acoustic guitar. A six-string single-cut Taylor 214-CE to be exact. I chose to put this picture up not only because I like the guitar, but also because it represents something much bigger than the guitar itself; it represents music. Music is by far my favorite way of expressing myself, and also one of the best ways of doing so. I love music because it brings out more than just thoughts, expressions, and melodies. It's a way of expressing that which cannot be put into words. My favorite instruments are the voice (yes, it's an instrument), guitar, and drums in that order. I currently serve on my church's worship team playing mainly drums and occasionally singing and playing guitar. I enjoy it more than anything, and I would honestly be happy doing that kind of work for the remainder of my life. It makes me wonder why I chose to study computer science..
